		<h1>Make Your Own Space Suit!</h1>
	
	</header>
	
<p>Now that you've learned about space suits, you can design your own! Here are the instructions: 
</p>
	<p class="list">
		1. Get a blank sheet of white paper and color pencils. </br>
		2. Design a space suit in anyway you want.</br>
		3. That's all!</br>
	</p>

<p class="hashtag">I'd love to see them, so if you could take a picture of them and hashtag is #myownspacesuit, that would be awesome.</p>

<p class="thanks">Thanks for letting me blab on. Check out the Aerospace Museum of California if you can! It's been fun! Have an awesome day. This has been Carl the Astronaut, signing off.</p>
