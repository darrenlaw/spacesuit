<p class="backpack">This backpack-looking object is what keeps me alive. It is called the Primary Life Support Subsystem (NASA). This has my oxygen tank, a battery, and fans to keep water and oxygen circulating. This is also the object that removes the carbon dioxide I exhale. </p>

<p class="underwear">With my Life Support System is the body suit I wear under my space suit. It is basically my underwear. My underwear has the tubes that carry oxygen and water to keep me cool and breathing.</p>
